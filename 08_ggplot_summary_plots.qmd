# Objective

## How to read in excel file and plot the data using GGPlot.

## Data for the exercise

[This page has a link to all of the data files](99_example_data_files.qmd)

We will use a mock data file that uses M&M's

[M&M CSV file](data/mms.csv) and also the [M&M Excel file](data/mms.xlsx)

## Load Libraries

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load the libraries each time you restart R
library("readxl") # read in excel files
library("skimr") # quick summary stats
library("janitor") # clean up excel imports
library("patchwork") # multipanel graphs
library(skimr) # great way to do summary stats
library("lubridate") # dates and times
library("scales") # scales on ggplot ases
library("tidyverse") # dplyr and piping and ggplot etc
```

##Read files

```{r}
# Note you can read in excel files just as easy
  mm.df <- read_excel("data/mms.xlsx")
  
  head(mm.df)


```

# Summary Stats

Lets look at a few ways to get summary statistics The first is the simplist and uses base R

```{r}
summary(mm.df)
```

A better way is using Skimr

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
mm.df %>% 
  skim()
```

The cool part of skimr is that you can do groups

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
mm.df %>% 
  group_by(center) %>% 
  skim()
```

Finally you can get a summary manually but is a bit longer. These can also be saved into a new dataframe.

```{r}
mm.df %>% 
  group_by(center, color) %>% 
  summarize(mean_diamter = mean(diameter, na.rm=TRUE),
            mean_mass = mean(mass, na.rm=TRUE))
```

# Graphing mean and SE

These are all well and good but looking at a graph is cool.

```{r}
# now for the plot
ggplot(mm.df, aes(color, diameter, color=color)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE,
               geom = "point",
               size = 3) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, na.rm = TRUE,
               geom = "errorbar",
               width = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "color", y = "Diamter (units)") 
```

We can also add in shape as a grouping varaible for the center of the m&m's

```{r}
# now for the plot
ggplot(mm.df, aes(color, diameter, group=center, shape=center, color=color)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE,
               geom = "point",
               size = 3) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, na.rm = TRUE,
               geom = "errorbar",
               width = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "color", y = "Diamter (units)") 
```


```{r}
# now for the plot
ggplot(mm.df, aes(color, diameter, group=center, shape=center, color=color)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE,
               geom = "point",
               size = 3,
               position= position_dodge(width = 0.2)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, na.rm = TRUE,
               geom = "errorbar",
               width = 0.2,
               position= position_dodge(width = 0.2)) +
  labs(x = "color", y = "Diamter (units)") 
```
