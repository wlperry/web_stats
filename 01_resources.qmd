This is a set of resources I have found to be super helpful in learning R.

I will follow the ideas presented in [**R for Data Science (2e)**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

A great resource for looking up issues is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) [![](/images/stackoverflow.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/)

For help with statistics I found [R Companion](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/) to be a GREAT resource [![](/images/rcompanion.png)](https://rcompanion.org/handbook/)
