# Introduction

Welcome to **R Resources** – a curated list of materials that I have found incredibly helpful in learning R. In this site, you'll find links to books, websites, and forums that can guide you on your R journey.

## Featured Resource: R for Data Science

I highly recommend [**R for Data Science (2e)**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) as a starting point.
