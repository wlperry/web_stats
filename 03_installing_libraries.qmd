# Installing Libraries

Libraries (or packages) are collections of R functions and data that extend R’s capabilities. In this guide, you’ll learn how to install and load some essential libraries to help you get started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing Essential Libraries

To add new functionality to R, you first need to install the libraries. Run the following commands in your R console:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")    # Tools for package development
install.packages("tidyverse")     # A suite of packages for data manipulation and visualization
install.packages("lubridate")     # Simplifies working with dates and times
install.packages("readxl")        # Reads Excel files
install.packages("janitor")       # Cleans up data imports
install.packages("patchwork")     # Combines multiple plots
install.packages("skimr")         # Provides quick summary statistics
install.packages("plotly")        # Enhances ggplot2 with interactivity
install.packages("scales")        # Helps with ggplot2 axis scaling```

```

### Load Libraries in scripts

After installation, load the libraries at the beginning of all of your R scripts using:

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate) 
library(scales) 
library(readxl) 
library(skimr) 
library(janitor) 
library(patchwork)
```

## Optional: Useful Add-in Libraries

Some libraries add helpful tools to RStudio’s Addins menu (but not Positron), making it easier to reformat your code. Install these once and then load them as needed:

``` r
install.packages("ggThemeAssist")  # Assists with reformatting code

install.packages("styler")         # Automatically styles your code
```

And load them with:

``` r
library(ggThemeAssist)
library(styler)
```

In RStudio, you might need to enable the add-ins toolbar. Simply go to **View \> Show Toolbar** to access them.

### These libraries are useful for general statistics and used quite often.

These are some of the better vetted statistical packages in my opinion for Anova and Linear Models

``` r
install.packages("car") # stats and ANOVA - essential 
install.packages("emmeans") # estimated marginal means for unbalanced designs 

# these only have to be installed and not run...
install.packages("multcomView") # paired comparisons - note this will interfear with DPLYR!!
install.packages("Rmisc") # stats 
install.packages("Hmisc") # stats install.packages("broom") # output models cleanly 
```

And load them with:

``` r
library(car)
library(emmeans)
```
