If you can look at your data you can begin to see patterns that you may have predicted and want to test statistically.

    "text": "So the first thing to think about in my opinion is the workflow or dataflow:\n\nWhat is the source and format of your data?\n\nwhat are the variables and units and how will you name them\n\ncontrolled vocabulary list\n\ndata structure in columns\n\n\nWhat is the final objective and use of your data and what output?\n\nwhat is the most flexible output\n\ngraphs\n\nsummary statistics\n\nstatistical analyses\n\n\nWhat is the flow of data\n\nsource and update frequency\nQA/QC and flagging of data\nTransformations or calculations to be made\nFinal data output for use - note never write to original dataframe\nSummary statistics\nGraphs\nStatistical Analyses\nReports with markdown\nAnnotate scripts and metadata\n\n\nSet up directory structure\n\nR Project Directory\n\nscripts/code\ndocuments\ndata\nfigures / output\nfinalized_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking about your data source first is important. Using a controlled vocabulary that references names of variables the same from project to project is critical. Defining these in a metadata document with the vocabulary and the units for each term so that future users can figure out what your codes mean is also useful.\n\n\n\nAs part of controlled vocabulary, the way you type the variable names is also important and also important to be consistent. I have found snake case to be the best for me and using the package Janitor works well to fix messy file names. The main problem is variable names with spaces requires back ticks (variable name) to use them and special characters (`!@#$%^&* and u(micro) etc.) are coded differently on different operating systems and create chaos. The different styles are below:\n\nsnake case - looks_like_this - separated by _ and all lower case and often most popular\nperiod separated - looks.like.this - separated by periods - may get confused with other commands\nlower camel case - looksLikeThis - ever word is capitilized after the first - often harder to type with all the shift caps\nupper camel case - LooksLikeThis - all words capitilized\nall lower case - lookslikethis - I find it messy and hard to read\n\nthe key is that you should have no spaces or special characters. If you do have spaces you use the back tick abc xyz on either side of the variable to call it.\nSpecial characters are often coded differently in mac and pc computers and will cause more headaches than you have after St. Patricks Day.\n\n\n\nKeeping a list of transformations and conversions can be helpful in coding and if it is in the meta data file, you can copy the transformations out of the document and if there are mistakes people can track it down fast.\n\n\n\nR uses a column format and all the data in a column has to be of the same type. You can, however, reference data by row and column as in excel.\nThe most common data formats you will run into are:\n\nNumeric - can be double or integer but that is not as important\nCharacter - text fields\nFactors - displayed often as text but is as levels behind the scenes\nDate - date format or PosixLt or Date\n\nnote this is in days since 1970-01-01 I believe\n\nDate time - date and time format together or PosixCt\n\nthis is in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00\nthis will be critical for many of you\n\nNote that if you mix formats within a column some of the variables will be converted to NA if say you have a column that is a character column which has mixed numbers and text and is then converted to numeric\n\n\n\n\nTypically when we enter data it is in wide format where an identifier is in the first column and the various variables are in separate columns. This is what is often easiest to enter into excel or wherever it is entered originally.\nThis format is often more difficult to work with in R and GGPlot so it is converted to long format where there is a column of identifiers, a column of variable names, and a column of values. The switch between these formats is often rather easy so it does not matter what format it is in.\nwide format:\nFor the M&M data set this would look like:\nColumns across the top would be:\n\ncenter - type of center - peanut or chocolate etc\ncolor - the outter shell color\ndiameter - the size\nmass - the weight\n\nlong format:\nThis would condense this format to fewer columns repeating center and color and have a column called dimension and one called values. The dimension would be diameter or mass and the value woudl be the value. This is not that effective in this small data set but it invalualbe in larger data sets. It also makes summary stats and graphing easier:\n\ncenter - type of center - peanut or chocolate etc\ncolor - the outer shell color\ndimension - diameter or mass\nvalue - either the diameter or weight\n\n\n\n\nI find it useful to maintain a read only file of the original data and never write to this file other than the original QA/QC flagging of the data if even then. I usually read from this file and save it to the finalized data folder where the data has been cleaned formatted and basic calculations done on it.\n\n\n\n\nIt is often very helpful prior to doing any code work to think about what the final output will look like and what the original data looks like and the steps between these two points.\n\n\n\nHaving a consistent project directory structure where code, data, and text is stored makes it easy to look at different directories and find what you are looking for. That is why I use the following structure. Choose what works for you and stick with it… please\n\n\n\nr_projects\n\nscripts\ndocuments\ndata\nfigures or output\nfinal_data\n\n\n\nUsing projects in R is super useful and you don’t have to worry about setting directories (setwd(*C:*)) between a mac and windows machine and all the paths are relative in there when you reference data or output directories and is the same on windows and mac.\n\n\n\nFrom the site File organization and best practices and Prime Hints naming files has many good practices. Of these the main theme is:\n\nUse a consistent naming theme\n\nuse date_term1_term2.xxx\nno spaces or other fancy characters\nmake the names human understandable\n\nUse natural ordering of files\n\nuse date at front or somewhere so you know the version\nuse logical ordering like 01_ 02_ 03_\n\nAvoid things like\n\nfinal thesis proposal.docx - I deal with many students and this is not helpful\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the love of all that is good - be sure to annotate you code using the # and whatever text helps describe the process you are doing - it will make the code easier to read and evaluate later when you are trying to figure out something really fast. You can also use it to search for code snippets as you are going along.\nMetadata files that document what you are doing and why and what the various conversions and statistical transformations are can be of great use later on as well. It is often challenging to figure out what the units are in for various variables or what they actually mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can write a comment # and then follow it with text and then 4 dashes ---- or #### and it will create a note in the outline view\n\n\n\nYou should use comments # with text behind it to annotate the purpose of what your are doing and what is happening in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\nSo lets start installing R and R studio\nR is its own program and can be retrieved from R Cran\n\nR Studio is a program that makes the interface and usability of R easier in my opinion and can be retrieved here R Studio\nWhen you get these installed we can load up R studio and look at the interface.\n\n\nStart R studio and you should see:\n\n\n\n\nNow to set up a new project in a new directory\n\nClick File - New Project\n\nclick New Directory\n\nclick New Project\n\nThen enter the name of the directory you want - Note it is helpful to have a directory of r_projects that you will store all your r projects in.\n\nThen in the upper right is a name of a project - test in this case - and the files will have the name of the project you will either open when you start RStudio or that you double click to open the project\n\nNow I typically create directories within this project to organize everything using the following scheme.\n\nAll projects have the same exact set up.\n\nScripts - where all the script files go\nData - where the original data goes and is never written to\nFigures - where you save pdf files of your graphs\nOutput - output of modified data\nDocuments - documents that relate to the project and meta data if needed\nThemes - a place to store themes for graphs - more later on\n\n\n\nnaming of scripts - note I now name scripts 01_import_and_clean.R and then in order from there in what is done."

If you can look at your data you can begin to see patterns that you may have predicted and want to test statistically.

You can also determine if the data is normally distributed and how the variances compare from one group to another.\nUsing proper GGPlot code you are supposed to have data = , y = and x = ….\nI have found that these are not necessary most of the time and we can talk about this later.\n\nHow to plot an XY plot\nThis is a basic XY plot of the data and is one of the first steps in exploring data. Later on we will look at how to modify this plot to be easier to interpret.\nThe dataframe comes first and the AES statement is the aesthetics or the x and y data you want to see. You can also add colors, shapes, fill, line types and some other things to map to the data in this statement.\nTry adding color = color inside the aes(x=color, y=diameter) statement. You can also try shape = color\n\n# GGplot uses layers to build a graph\n\nggplot(data=mm.df, aes(x=color, y=diameter)) + # this sets up data \n  geom_point() # this adds a geometry to present the data from above\n\n\n\n\nBecause GGPlot builds things in layers you can add other geoms to the plot. Below you should try this code and see what happens when you put in + after geom_line() and then add geom_boxplot(fill=\"blue\"). Note try putting in before or after the geom_point() line.\n\n# Add geom_point() -----\n# Add points to the graph below using geom_point()\nggplot(mm.df, aes(x=color, y=diameter)) +\n  geom_point()"

    "text": "So the first thing to think about in my opinion is the workflow or dataflow:\n\nWhat is the source and format of your data?\n\nwhat are the variables and units and how will you name them\n\ncontrolled vocabulary list\n\ndata structure in columns\n\n\nWhat is the final objective and use of your data and what output?\n\nwhat is the most flexible output\n\ngraphs\n\nsummary statistics\n\nstatistical analyses\n\n\nWhat is the flow of data\n\nsource and update frequency\nQA/QC and flagging of data\nTransformations or calculations to be made\nFinal data output for use - note never write to original dataframe\nSummary statistics\nGraphs\nStatistical Analyses\nReports with markdown\nAnnotate scripts and metadata\n\n\nSet up directory structure\n\nR Project Directory\n\nscripts/code\ndocuments\ndata\nfigures / output\nfinalized_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking about your data source first is important. Using a controlled vocabulary that references names of variables the same from project to project is critical. Defining these in a metadata document with the vocabulary and the units for each term so that future users can figure out what your codes mean is also useful.\n\n\n\nAs part of controlled vocabulary, the way you type the variable names is also important and also important to be consistent. I have found snake case to be the best for me and using the package Janitor works well to fix messy file names. The main problem is variable names with spaces requires back ticks (variable name) to use them and special characters (`!@#$%^&* and u(micro) etc.) are coded differently on different operating systems and create chaos. The different styles are below:\n\nsnake case - looks_like_this - separated by _ and all lower case and often most popular\nperiod separated - looks.like.this - separated by periods - may get confused with other commands\nlower camel case - looksLikeThis - ever word is capitilized after the first - often harder to type with all the shift caps\nupper camel case - LooksLikeThis - all words capitilized\nall lower case - lookslikethis - I find it messy and hard to read\n\nthe key is that you should have no spaces or special characters. If you do have spaces you use the back tick abc xyz on either side of the variable to call it.\nSpecial characters are often coded differently in mac and pc computers and will cause more headaches than you have after St. Patricks Day.\n\n\n\nKeeping a list of transformations and conversions can be helpful in coding and if it is in the meta data file, you can copy the transformations out of the document and if there are mistakes people can track it down fast.\n\n\n\nR uses a column format and all the data in a column has to be of the same type. You can, however, reference data by row and column as in excel.\nThe most common data formats you will run into are:\n\nNumeric - can be double or integer but that is not as important\nCharacter - text fields\nFactors - displayed often as text but is as levels behind the scenes\nDate - date format or PosixLt or Date\n\nnote this is in days since 1970-01-01 I believe\n\nDate time - date and time format together or PosixCt\n\nthis is in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00\nthis will be critical for many of you\n\nNote that if you mix formats within a column some of the variables will be converted to NA if say you have a column that is a character column which has mixed numbers and text and is then converted to numeric\n\n\n\n\nTypically when we enter data it is in wide format where an identifier is in the first column and the various variables are in separate columns. This is what is often easiest to enter into excel or wherever it is entered originally.\nThis format is often more difficult to work with in R and GGPlot so it is converted to long format where there is a column of identifiers, a column of variable names, and a column of values. The switch between these formats is often rather easy so it does not matter what format it is in.\nwide format:\nFor the M&M data set this would look like:\nColumns across the top would be:\n\ncenter - type of center - peanut or chocolate etc\ncolor - the outter shell color\ndiameter - the size\nmass - the weight\n\nlong format:\nThis would condense this format to fewer columns repeating center and color and have a column called dimension and one called values. The dimension would be diameter or mass and the value woudl be the value. This is not that effective in this small data set but it invalualbe in larger data sets. It also makes summary stats and graphing easier:\n\ncenter - type of center - peanut or chocolate etc\ncolor - the outer shell color\ndimension - diameter or mass\nvalue - either the diameter or weight\n\n\n\n\nI find it useful to maintain a read only file of the original data and never write to this file other than the original QA/QC flagging of the data if even then. I usually read from this file and save it to the finalized data folder where the data has been cleaned formatted and basic calculations done on it.\n\n\n\n\nIt is often very helpful prior to doing any code work to think about what the final output will look like and what the original data looks like and the steps between these two points.\n\n\n\nHaving a consistent project directory structure where code, data, and text is stored makes it easy to look at different directories and find what you are looking for. That is why I use the following structure. Choose what works for you and stick with it… please\n\n\n\nr_projects\n\nscripts\ndocuments\ndata\nfigures or output\nfinal_data\n\n\n\nUsing projects in R is super useful and you don’t have to worry about setting directories (setwd(*C:*)) between a mac and windows machine and all the paths are relative in there when you reference data or output directories and is the same on windows and mac.\n\n\n\nFrom the site File organization and best practices and Prime Hints naming files has many good practices. Of these the main theme is:\n\nUse a consistent naming theme\n\nuse date_term1_term2.xxx\nno spaces or other fancy characters\nmake the names human understandable\n\nUse natural ordering of files\n\nuse date at front or somewhere so you know the version\nuse logical ordering like 01_ 02_ 03_\n\nAvoid things like\n\nfinal thesis proposal.docx - I deal with many students and this is not helpful\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the love of all that is good - be sure to annotate you code using the # and whatever text helps describe the process you are doing - it will make the code easier to read and evaluate later when you are trying to figure out something really fast. You can also use it to search for code snippets as you are going along.\nMetadata files that document what you are doing and why and what the various conversions and statistical transformations are can be of great use later on as well. It is often challenging to figure out what the units are in for various variables or what they actually mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can write a comment # and then follow it with text and then 4 dashes ---- or #### and it will create a note in the outline view\n\n\n\nYou should use comments # with text behind it to annotate the purpose of what your are doing and what is happening in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\nSo lets start installing R and R studio\nR is its own program and can be retrieved from R Cran\n\nR Studio is a program that makes the interface and usability of R easier in my opinion and can be retrieved here R Studio\nWhen you get these installed we can load up R studio and look at the interface.\n\n\nStart R studio and you should see:\n\n\n\n\nNow to set up a new project in a new directory\n\nClick File - New Project\n\nclick New Directory\n\nclick New Project\n\nThen enter the name of the directory you want - Note it is helpful to have a directory of r_projects that you will store all your r projects in.\n\nThen in the upper right is a name of a project - test in this case - and the files will have the name of the project you will either open when you start RStudio or that you double click to open the project\n\nNow I typically create directories within this project to organize everything using the following scheme.\n\nAll projects have the same exact set up.\n\nScripts - where all the script files go\nData - where the original data goes and is never written to\nFigures - where you save pdf files of your graphs\nOutput - output of modified data\nDocuments - documents that relate to the project and meta data if needed\nThemes - a place to store themes for graphs - more later on\n\n\n\nnaming of scripts - note I now name scripts 01_import_and_clean.R and then in order from there in what is done."

    "text": "Thinking about your data source first is important. Using a controlled vocabulary that references names of variables the same from project to project is critical. Defining these in a metadata document with the vocabulary and the units for each term so that future users can figure out what your codes mean is also useful.\n\n\n\nAs part of controlled vocabulary, the way you type the variable names is also important and also important to be consistent. I have found snake case to be the best for me and using the package Janitor works well to fix messy file names. The main problem is variable names with spaces requires back ticks (variable name) to use them and special characters (`!@#$%^&* and u(micro) etc.) are coded differently on different operating systems and create chaos. The different styles are below:\n\nsnake case - looks_like_this - separated by _ and all lower case and often most popular\nperiod separated - looks.like.this - separated by periods - may get confused with other commands\nlower camel case - looksLikeThis - ever word is capitilized after the first - often harder to type with all the shift caps\nupper camel case - LooksLikeThis - all words capitilized\nall lower case - lookslikethis - I find it messy and hard to read\n\nthe key is that you should have no spaces or special characters. If you do have spaces you use the back tick abc xyz on either side of the variable to call it.\nSpecial characters are often coded differently in mac and pc computers and will cause more headaches than you have after St. Patricks Day.\n\n\n\nKeeping a list of transformations and conversions can be helpful in coding and if it is in the meta data file, you can copy the transformations out of the document and if there are mistakes people can track it down fast.\n\n\n\nR uses a column format and all the data in a column has to be of the same type. You can, however, reference data by row and column as in excel.\nThe most common data formats you will run into are:\n\nNumeric - can be double or integer but that is not as important\nCharacter - text fields\nFactors - displayed often as text but is as levels behind the scenes\nDate - date format or PosixLt or Date\n\nnote this is in days since 1970-01-01 I believe\n\nDate time - date and time format together or PosixCt\n\nthis is in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00\nthis will be critical for many of you\n\nNote that if you mix formats within a column some of the variables will be converted to NA if say you have a column that is a character column which has mixed numbers and text and is then converted to numeric\n\n\n\n\nTypically when we enter data it is in wide format where an identifier is in the first column and the various variables are in separate columns. This is what is often easiest to enter into excel or wherever it is entered originally.\nThis format is often more difficult to work with in R and GGPlot so it is converted to long format where there is a column of identifiers, a column of variable names, and a column of values. The switch between these formats is often rather easy so it does not matter what format it is in.\nwide format:\nFor the M&M data set this would look like:\nColumns across the top would be:\n\ncenter - type of center - peanut or chocolate etc\ncolor - the outter shell color\ndiameter - the size\nmass - the weight\n\nlong format:\nThis would condense this format to fewer columns repeating center and color and have a column called dimension and one called values. The dimension would be diameter or mass and the value woudl be the value. This is not that effective in this small data set but it invalualbe in larger data sets. It also makes summary stats and graphing easier:\n\ncenter - type of center - peanut or chocolate etc\ncolor - the outer shell color\ndimension - diameter or mass\nvalue - either the diameter or weight\n\n\n\n\nI find it useful to maintain a read only file of the original data and never write to this file other than the original QA/QC flagging of the data if even then. I usually read from this file and save it to the finalized data folder where the data has been cleaned formatted and basic calculations done on it."

If you can look at your data you can begin to see patterns that you may have predicted and want to test statistically. You will also be able to see outliers that exist that might affect results faster than looking at summary statistics. You can also determine if the data is normally distributed and how the variances compare from one group to another.\nUsing proper GGPlot code you are supposed to have data = , y = and x = ….\nI have found that these are not necessary most of the time and we can talk about this later.\n\nHow to plot an XY plot\nThis is a basic XY plot of the data and is one of the first steps in exploring data. Later on we will look at how to modify this plot to be easier to interpret.\nThe dataframe comes first and the AES statement is the aesthetics or the x and y data you want to see. You can also add colors, shapes, fill, line types and some other things to map to the data in this statement.\nTry adding color = color inside the aes(x=color, y=diameter) statement. You can also try shape = color\n\n# GGplot uses layers to build a graph\n\nggplot(data=mm.df, aes(x=color, y=diameter)) + # this sets up data \n  geom_point() # this adds a geometry to present the data from above\n\n\n\n\nBecause GGPlot builds things in layers you can add other geoms to the plot. Below you should try this code and see what happens when you put in + after geom_line() and then add geom_boxplot(fill=\"blue\"). Note try putting in before or after the geom_point() line.\n\n# Add geom_point() -----\n# Add points to the graph below using geom_point()\nggplot(mm.df, aes(x=color, y=diameter)) +\n  geom_point()"
