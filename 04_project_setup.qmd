# Designing Your Data Project

A well-planned project makes data curation and final analysis easier. Here’s a simple guide to help you get started.

## 1. Plan Your Data Flow

-   **Data Source:**\
    Identify where your data comes from, its format, and the variables (with clear names and units).

-   **Objective & Output:**\
    Decide what you want in the end—whether that’s graphs, summary statistics, or reports.

-   **Workflow:**\
    Outline these steps:

    -   How frequently data is updated and checked (QA/QC).
    -   Any transformations or calculations.
    -   Produce a final, cleaned output without altering your original data.

## 2. Organize Your Project Structure

Keep your work tidy with a consistent folder structure. For example:

-   **scripts/** – Your R scripts
-   **data/** – Raw, read-only data files
-   **output/** – Cleaned data and analysis results
-   **figures/** – Graphs and plots
-   **documents/** – Project notes and metadata

## 3. Standardize and Document Your Data

-   **Consistent Naming:**\
    Use a controlled vocabulary (e.g., **snake_case**) to avoid spaces and special characters in variable names.

-   **Format Awareness:**\
    Make sure each data column holds the same type (numeric, character, date, etc.) and consider converting wide data to long format for easier analysis.

-   **Documentation:**\
    Comment your code using `#` and maintain a metadata file that explains variable names, units, and any transformations applied.

## 4. Get Started with R and RStudio

-   **Set Up a Project in RStudio:**\
    Use RStudio’s project feature to create a new directory with your folders already set up. This ensures all file paths are relative and consistent across different systems.

By following these simple steps, you’ll build a solid foundation for curating your data and conducting your final analysis.

## 5. Designing the folder structure of each project

It is very helpful to use the same design for each project to organize the files. I typically use

-   data

-   scripts

-   output

-   figures

-   documents
