# Introduction for R and tidyverse - for the Rogue R class

Welcome to our seminar course on using R for common statistical tests that you might apply in your thesis research. This course serves as an introduction to R and RStudio, drawing from our introductory biostatistics curriculum. In addition, this site is a repository for all the course materials and the specialized analyses we'll cover later in the term.

I have found R to be a life-changing tool and use it nearly every day. I'm excited to share these resources with you!
