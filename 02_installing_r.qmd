## Installing R

R is a standalone program that does all the heavy lifting behind the scenes. To install R, follow these steps:

1. **Download R from CRAN:**  
   Visit the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download the version of R that matches your operating system. (Fun fact: R versions are named after Charlie Brown episodes!)  
   _Tip: Check for updates every six months to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes._

2. **Run the Installer:**  
   After downloading, run the installer and follow the on‑screen instructions.

## Installing RStudio

Once you have R installed, it’s time to install RStudio—the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier.

1. **Download RStudio:**  
   Visit the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to get the installer for your computer.

2. **Install and Launch RStudio:**  
   After installing, open RStudio. It will automatically connect to the installed version of R, providing a streamlined interface to work with scripts, data, and visualizations.
