# How to install R and R Studio

## Installing R

R is a standalone program that can be used to do all the work we do. RStudio sits on top of R and allows the user to see a lot more of what is going on behind the scenes like what is loaded in the environment or dataframes that are loaded or graphs that have been made.

First we will install R:

Go to CRAN to download R for your particular computer system you are using. Note all R versions are named after Charlie Brown episodes. You will need to update this say every 6 months but downloading it and reinstalling

[CRAN is located here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## Installing R Studio

Then you need to go to [POSIT to install RStudio here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

Note they also have a link to R. Once installed you should be able open it and it will be a running version of RStudio. Then we are on to installing packages.
