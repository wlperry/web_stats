Here’s a simple guide to help you get started.\n\n## 1. Plan Your Data Flow\n\n-   **Data Source:**\\\n    Identify where your data comes from, its format, and the variables (with clear names and units).\n\n-   **Objective & Output:**\\\n    Decide what you want in the end—whether that’s graphs, summary statistics, or reports.\n\n-   **Workflow:**\\\n    Outline these steps:\n\n    -   How frequently data is updated and checked (QA/QC).\n    -   Any transformations or calculations.\n    -   Produce a final, cleaned output without altering your original data.\n\n## 2. Organize Your Project Structure\n\nKeep your work tidy with a consistent folder structure. For example:\n\n-   **scripts/** – Your R scripts\n-   **data/** – Raw, read-only data files\n-   **output/** – Cleaned data and analysis results\n-   **figures/** – Graphs and plots\n-   **documents/** – Project notes and metadata\n\n## 3. Standardize and Document Your Data\n\n-   **Consistent Naming:**\\\n    Use a controlled vocabulary (e.g., **snake_case**) to avoid spaces and special characters in variable names.\n\n-   **Format Awareness:**\\\n    Make sure each data column holds the same type (numeric, character, date, etc.) and consider converting wide data to long format for easier analysis.\n\n-   **Documentation:**\\\n    Comment your code using `#` and maintain a metadata file that explains variable names, units, and any transformations applied.\n\n## 4. Get Started with R and RStudio\n\n-   **Set Up a Project in RStudio:**\\\n    Use RStudio’s project feature to create a new directory with your folders already set up. This ensures all file paths are relative and consistent across different systems.\n\nBy following these simple steps, you’ll build a solid foundation for curating your data and conducting your final analysis.\n\n## 5. Designing the folder structure of each project\n\nIt is very helpful to use the same design for each project to organize the files. I typically use\n\n-   data\n\n-   scripts\n\n-   output\n\n-   figures\n\n-   documents\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Designing Your Data Project\n\nA well-planned project makes data curation and final analysis easier.
